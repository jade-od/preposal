# Preproposal

##What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Cat game in pygames,  3 minigames in  1 game. We'll draw the sprites and attach them to the game. 
Ideas for the minigames: Using the arrow keys, how many times can you catch the cat in 1 minute
Jump the hurdles (similar to Google Dino game)
Pet simulator (feed, bathe, pet...)
Snake game imitation (cat catching a mouse.. maybe a 2 player game/player plays against bot?)
Jigsaw/memory puzzle?


##If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Jade O'Dowd, Olivia Walton

##Do you have any questions of your own?
How do you create/attach a sprite?
Would we create a URL to our own website?
